# Gmrspace
Gmrspace is a website for gamers that contains a collection of games and articles related to these games. The site is developed on the HTML5, CSS3, and JS stack and uses the MongoDB database to store and organize information about games and articles.

On the site, users can browse the collection of games and read articles related to them. Each game has its own page with detailed information, including a description of the game, images and videos, user reviews, and links to articles related to that game.

In addition, the site contains a section with articles that discuss various aspects of the games, including reviews, tips and strategies.

The Gmrspace repository contains the code for the front- and back-end of the site, as well as database schemas and scripts for its customization.
